Chapter 1: Defining Psychology
In summary chapter 1 lays down the basic principles of which psychology is built upon. The chapter also
introduces a few examples to explain how psychologists thrive on using objective evidence to explain
premade assumptions. Topics such as, whether or not birth order affects personality, or how ones relgion
and way of life affect somebody's ability (or a group of people) to be able to forgive.

Key Terms:
* Psychology: The scientific study of behavior and mental processes.
* Science: The use of systematic methods to observe the natural world and draw conclusions.
* Behavior: Ecerything we do that can be directly observed.
* Mental Processes: The thoughts, feelings, and motives that each of us experiences privately but that 
  cannot be observed directly.

Chapter 2: Psychology in Historical Perspective
In summary, psychology's beginning routes begin far beyond in the past. Dating back to ancient greece
philospheres such as Socrates, PLato, and Aristotle (these philosphers tried to distinguished the
possible link between the mind and body, and looked for continuous answers throughout history
in a natural sense instead of a supernatural sense such as relgion.

Important Side Note:
* Wilhelm Wundt(1832 - 1920), a German philosopher and physician studied how long it took for a human
  to react to a sound and press a button on the telegraph. Because of this desire to measure mental 
  processes, it naturally ushered the new science of psychology.
* Wundt's students and him started INTROSPECTION to explore mental processes.
* Although Wundt is most often regarded as the founding father of modern pyschology,
  Psychologost and philosopher William James(1842 - 1910) gave psychology the american stamp.
* William James differed to Wundt in that instead of structralism he emphasized on functionalism,
  which probed the funtions and purposes of the mind and and behavior in the individuals adaptation
  to the environment. Whereas structuralists were looking inside the mind and searching for its
  structures, functionalists focused on human interactions with the outside world and the purpose
  of thoughts. If structuralism is about the “what” of the mind, functionalism is about the “why.”

* Charles Darwin Section:
  Darwin's natural selection is important to psychologists because it expands upon very keen observation
  which is a very large part of psychology.

Key Terms:
* Structuralism: Wundt's approach to discovering the basic elements, or structures, of mental processes;
  so called because of its focus on identifying the structures of the human mind.
* Functionalism: James's approach to mental processes, emphasizing the functions and purposes of the
  mind and behavior in the indicidual's adaptation to the environment.
* Natural Selection: Darwin's principle of an evolutionary process in which organizms that are better 
  adapted to their environemnt will survive and produce more offspring.

Chapter 3: Contemptorary Approches to Psychology
7 approaches that represent the intellection backdrop of psychological science:

* Biological - psychologists examind behavior and mental processes through bodily functions.
  Example: the path of Neuroscience.

* Behavioral - emphasizes the scientific study of observable behavioral responses and their enironemnta
  determinants.

* Psychodynamic - emphasizes unconscious thought, the conflict between biological drives (such as 
  the drive for sex) and society's demands, and early child family experiences.

* Humanistic - emphasizes a person's positive qualities, the capacity for positive growth, 
  and the freedom to choose one's destiny.

* Cognitive - emphasizes the mental process invloved in knowing: how we direct our attention, perceive,
  remember, think, andn solve problems.

* Evolutionary - uses evolutionary ideas such as adaptation, reproduction, and natural selecton as 
  the basis for explaining specific human behaviors. 

* Sociocultural - examines the ways in which social and cultural environments influence behavior.

  Summary: These seven psychological approaches provide different views of the same behavior, and all
  of them may offer valuable insights that the other perspectives miss.
  
Key terms:
* Biological Approach: An approach to psychology focusing on the body, especially on the brain and 
  nervous system.
* Neuroscience: The Scientific study of the structure, functon, development, genetics, and biochemistry
  of the nervous system, emphasizing that the brain and nervous system are central to understanding
  , thought, and emotion.
* Behavioral Approach: An approach to psychology focusing on the scienctific study of observable 
  behavioral responses and their environmental determinants.
* Psychodynamic Approach: An approach to psychology focusing on unconscious thought, the conflict 
  between biological drives( such as the drive for sec) and society's demands, and early childhood
  family experiences.
* Humanistic Approach: An approach to psychology focusing on a person's positive qualities, the capacity
  for positive growth, and the freedom to choose one's destiny.
* Cognitive Approach: An approach to psychology focusing on the mental processes involved in knowing:
  how we direct our attention, perceive, remember, think, and solve problems.
* Evolutionary Approach: An approach to psychology focusing on evolutionary ideas such as adaptation,
  reproduction, and natural selection as the basis for explaining specific human behaviors.
* Sociocultural Approach: An approach to psychology focusing on the ways in which social and cultural 
  environments influence behavior.

Chapter 4: What Psychologists Do

Figure 1:
Shows the various settings in which psychologists practice thier profession.

* Individuals who are primarily enganged in helping others are often called practicioners of psychology
  (mostly doing thing such as clinical practice, seeing clients, and guiding them through their problem)

Difference between a clinical psychologist and psychiatrist:
* A clinical psychologist typically has a doctoral degree in psychology, which requires approximately
  four to five years of graduate work and one year of internship in a mental health facility.

* In contrast, a psychiatrist is a physician with a medical degree who subsequently specializes in
  abnormal behavior and psychotherapy.

* Another difference between a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist is that a psychiatrist can
  prescribe drugs, whereas a clinical psychologist generally cannot. 

* Despite these differences, clinical psychologists and psychiatrists are alike in sharing an 
  interest in improving the lives of people with mental health problems.

Areas of Spcialisation:
Pyschology has many areas of specialization, currently there are 56 divisions in the American
Psychological Association, each focusing on a specific subfield of Psychology.

Division 1, the Society for General Psychology, seeks to provide a coherent integration of the vast
science of psychology. Division 2, the Society for the Teaching of Psychology, is dedicated to devising
the best ways to help students learn about this fascinating science. The other main specializations in 
the field of psychology include the following.

* Physiological Psychology and Behavioral Neuroscience
* Sensation and Perception
* Learning
* Cognitive Psychology
* Developmental Psychology
* Motivation and Emotion
* Psychology of Women and Gender
* Personality Psychology
* Social Psychology
* Industrial and Organnizational Psychology
* Clinical and Counseling Psychology
* Health Psychology
* Community Psychology
* School and Educatoinal Psychology
* Environmental Psychology
* Forensic Psychology
* Sport Psychology
* Cross - Cultural Psychology
