Like Descartes, I agree that my beliefs about what the world is like and what is true of reality is 
based on my senses and sense perception. Here is an example as to why I believe this. As a much
younger kid, I was much more naive. One of the earliest memories of me being naive was not
understanding the value of money. I used to think that $50 was hardly any cash but as I got older
I started to do chores and realized how much work was required to get paid. Additionally, as I got 
older I started to see the instense amount of sacrifice my parents were putting into their work in order
to bring money and food home for the family. Overtime, my senses and sense perception matured which 
greatly changed how I saw the world and made me more appreciative of many things in life. This
particular example is almost exclusively through the sense of sight.

I agree with the argument that beliefs/opinions about what is real and true regarding the world are
doubtful and uncertain. This is because terms such as beliefs and opinions are defined as unchecked
truths generally. Which naturally means that because opinions and beliefs are not fact, I am naturally
doubtful and uncertain about them.
