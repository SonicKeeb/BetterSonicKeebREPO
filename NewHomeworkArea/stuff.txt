What have you learned about your academic habits so far this semester? Discuss your performance in terms of your study skills, organization, class attendance, procrastination, etc.

- I have procrastinated less and really optimized my time in between classes where I have an hour or more between the classes I get ahead and study towards getting work done earlier. I've organized my files in a more easy to read and categorized way. I've stayed ahead of the curve and vary rarely(unless it is something I can get done easily and I know for sure that I can). I've gone in person to every needed class, and since all classes now are basically in person I go to all of them except for times there is an online lecture or online quiz where I don't have to show up.

What academic achievements are you most proud of this semester? Why?

-I've managed to retain primairly A's across all of my classes with a few B's here and there primarily in Calculus because it is more challenging in comparison to my other classes but at the same time this class as well because I turned in something late which really sucks because I could have an easy A which I need to work hard in order to get back.

Are you satisfied with your progress in your classes so far? Explain what has been most satisfying or dissatisfying about each class this semester.

-Overall yes I am satisfied with my overall progress although it is not over yet and I still want to aim and achieve hiagher

What resources are you using to help assist with your classes?

-Besides extranneous things on google just the usual notes and then a classmate that helps me out with Calculus and that's about it

How did you prepare for your midterm exams or any exams you have had over the semester? Has the method of preparation been successful?

-For Calculus I went over problems that I didn't really understand and read over everything before taking it and then did nothing else so that my mind could be clear and focused.

What organizational and time management habits did you maintain in the semester?

-I used the reminder app on Apple devices to keep track of when assignments were due and when to start doing them in a way that I had extra time throughout the day to do other things

Did you miss any classes this semester? How many? Why? What actions did you take to mitigate potential issues related to your absences? For example, did you contact your professor, gather notes from your peers, etc.? How did missing class affect you, if at all?

-I have not missed any classes this semester

What are your goals for the rest of the semester? How do you plan to reach them?

-I plan to keep studying and hopfully have all A's that will grant me a half scholarship at the very leaset to decrease in the costs of attending the school
